# Contributing to Pumpkin Plugin API

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pumpkin Plugin API! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Familiarity with Minecraft server mechanics
- Understanding of plugin API design principles
- Knowledge of async Rust programming

### Development Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork locally
3. Set up the development environment
4. Run tests to ensure everything works

## üìã How to Contribute

### Choosing What to Work On
1. Browse the [main README](./README.md) for available features
2. Check the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/PumpkinPlugins/API-Tracker/issues) for specific tasks
3. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` if you're new
4. Comment on an issue to claim it before starting work

### Implementation Process
1. **Research**: Understand the feature requirements thoroughly
2. **Design**: Consider API ergonomics and Rust best practices
3. **Implement**: Write the code following our guidelines
4. **Test**: Add comprehensive tests for your implementation
5. **Document**: Update documentation and add examples
6. **Submit**: Create a pull request with clear description

## üéØ Implementation Priorities

### High Priority
Features that other systems depend on should be implemented first:
- Core Infrastructure components
- Basic player and world management
- Essential item and inventory systems

### Medium Priority
Features that enhance gameplay but aren't blocking other development:
- Advanced player management features
- Visual effects and particle systems
- Teams and scoreboard APIs
- Custom crafting recipes

### Low Priority
Nice-to-have features that can be implemented later:
- Custom enchantments
- NPC API
- Advanced PvP management
- Complex visual effects

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### API Design Principles
- **Ergonomic**: APIs should be intuitive and easy to use
- **Type Safe**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent errors
- **Async First**: Use async/await for operations that might block
- **Memory Safe**: No unsafe code without exceptional justification
- **Performance**: Consider performance implications of all APIs

### Code Structure
```
pumpkin/src/plugin/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ api/            # Core infrastructure
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loader/         # Player management APIs
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mod.rs          # Main library exports
```

### Error Handling
- Use `Result<T, E>` for fallible operations
- Define specific error types for different API categories
- Provide helpful error messages for plugin developers
- Consider recovery strategies where appropriate

### Async Patterns
- Use `tokio` for async runtime
- Prefer async APIs for I/O operations
- Use channels for cross-thread communication
- Document thread safety guarantees

## üìù Code Standards

### Rust Style
- Follow official Rust style guidelines
- Use `rustfmt` for consistent formatting
- Run `clippy` and address all warnings
- Write comprehensive documentation comments

### Documentation
- Document all public APIs with examples
- Include usage patterns and common pitfalls
- Update relevant documentation files
- Add examples to the `examples/` directory

### Testing
- Write unit tests for all functionality
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Ensure tests are deterministic and reliable

## üîç Review Process

### Pull Request Guidelines
1. **Clear Title**: Describe what the PR accomplishes
2. **Detailed Description**: Explain the changes and reasoning
3. **Issue References**: Link to related issues
4. **Testing**: Describe how the changes were tested
5. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly mark any breaking changes

### Review Criteria
- Code quality and adherence to guidelines
- API design and ergonomics
- Performance implications
- Documentation completeness
- Test coverage and quality
